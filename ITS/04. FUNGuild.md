```
Note: Before any clean up, we had 24,154 ASV's in the ITS dataset.
First we removed all the NA's in the taxon column. This leaves us with 13,904 ASV's.  
Then, we only keep the "highly probable" and "probable" confidence levels. This leaves is with 8076 ASV's.

There are three trophics modes: (1)pathotroph, (2)symbiotroph and (3)saprotroph  
There are 12 guilds: (1)animal pathogens, (2)arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, (3) ectomycorrhizal fungi, (4) ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, (5) mycoparasites, (6)plant pathogens, (7)undefined root endophytes, (8)undefined saprotrophs (9) foliar endophytes, (10)lichenicolous fungi, (11) lichenized fungi, (12) wood saprotrophs.



After rarefiation we have 282 samples left.
Filtering out all MT samples yields 188 samples left.
Filtering down to rhizosphere yields 11 samples and 1351 ASV's
Then we filtered out all the "NA's and "possilbe" confidence rankings from FUNGuild and are left with 320 ASV's.
Fianlly after filtering out all guilds that had multiple assignments we are left with 182 ASV's.
