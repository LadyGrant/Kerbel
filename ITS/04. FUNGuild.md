# Analsis using FUNGuild

On the terminal use the following command:
```

```
Note that before this is used, we had 24,154 ASV's in the ITS dataset with 311 samples.
After rarefiation we have 282 samples left.
Filtering out all MT samples yields 188 samples left.
Filtering down to rhizosphere yields 11 samples and 1351 ASV's
Then we filtered out all the "NA's and "possilbe" confidence rankings from FUNGuild and are left with 320 ASV's.
Fianlly after filtering out all guilds that had multiple assignments we are left with 182 ASV's.
